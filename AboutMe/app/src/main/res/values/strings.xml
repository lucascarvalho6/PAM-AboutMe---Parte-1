    <string name="bio">Hi, my name is Aleks.
    \n\nI love fish.
    \n\nThe kind that is alive and swims around in an aquarium or river, or a lake, and definitely the ocean.
    \nFun fact is that I have several aquariums and also a river.
    \n\nI Like eating fish, too. Ran fish. Grilled fish. Smoked fish. Poached fish - not so much.
    \nAnd sometimes I even go fishing.
    \nAnd even less sometimes, I actually catch something.
    \n\n0nce, when I was camping in Canada, and very hungry, i even caught a large salmon with my hands.
    \n\nI\'lL be happy to teach you how to make your oun aquarium.
    \nYou should ask someone else about fishing, though. \n\n
